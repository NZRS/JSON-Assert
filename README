JSON-Assert
Test-JSON-Assert
================

These two modules help you check that what you expect to be in an JSON document
is actually there. You can do this via

The JSON::Assert module exports the assert() function. This ...

* json_match( jpath, count wanted, msg );
* jpath_is( jpath, value, msg );

Examples:

* json_matches( '$.NZSRSResponse.Response.Domain', 1, "Response contains one domain record" );
* jpath_is( '$.NZSRSResponse.Response.Domain', '{ DomainName => "foo.co.te"}', "Response DomainName is foo.co.te" );

EXAMPLE JSON ASSERTIONS
=======================

For example, in the following document, you can assert a number of things, for
example, that you expect one <content> hash in the document, and that it's
value is "Hello, World!":

    use JSON;

    my $json = <<'EOF';
    NZSRSResponse:
      Response:
        Domain: foo.co.te
        Status: Available
    EOF

    my $data = decode_json $json;
   
    my $json_assert = JSON::Assert->new();

    $json_assert->is_jpath_count($data, '$.NZSRSResponse.Response.Domain', 1);
    $json_assert->does_jpath_value_match($doc, '$.NZSRSResponse.Response.Domain', 'Hello, World!')
